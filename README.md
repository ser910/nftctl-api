# nftctl-api

**nftctl-api** is a RESTful backend service written in Python using FastAPI, designed to manage Linux firewall rules via `nftables`.

This project aims to be a modular, extensible replacement backend for OPNsense-style systems on Linux, replacing `pf` and FreeBSD dependencies with `nftables` and Python.
